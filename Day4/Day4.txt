Completed manually

bcos I'm qUirkY lik dat

the random accompanying files are artefacts of my manual computation

used vscode and its text find and select all tools to replace numbers from the callout sequence on all board where they appeared

in the end it probably took longer than it would have took me to code it, but on the off chance that I didn't make any
mistakes in the manual work, perhaps it could have been faster
